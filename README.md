docverwaltung
=============

an easy tool to scan and classify your documents xD

You can scan your documents as searchable PDFs and classify them to different folders over a web interface.

This project uses @wunderlins webrest as a submodule for the communication between the webclient and the server and webpy as a webserver for the web interface.
